# JavaAssessment

Reflection Questions:
What did you like about this project?
It is challenging, like always! But this project gives me the opportunity to see how each Class methods contribute in deriving the required information.

What did you struggle with in this project?
I was initially overwhelmed by so many 'almost' same words like StudentService, studentService etc, and had to take quite some time to digest the information. And I was trying to figure out how to access the Course ID, and add in a grade for the specific course. Not too sure how I can fully utilized the given methods to solve the puzzle! :(

What would make your experience with this assessment better?
If I had more time, will probably go through the codes once more and not feeling so rushed to complete asap.
